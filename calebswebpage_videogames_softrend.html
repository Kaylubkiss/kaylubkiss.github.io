    This assignment was entirely done by using nothing but code, with no next-to-no help from the GPU to compile shader programs and project objects to the screen. We combined our knowledge of the math and our coding knowledge to create the final render on-screen.

    This is the most interesting function, so I'll briefly break it down.

  - The function takes two indexes.

  - Each mesh should be a collection of vertices and thus faces.

  - The texture data is in bitmap coordinates, so it is of type "bitmap."

  - The loop is basically what a shader program does to each mesh and texture coordinate. We are creating an array of transformations for the vertices/coordinates going to device (screen) space, or world space coming from object space.

    - Each face of the mesh is three vertices (triangular)
- P, Q, R are used to find the Axis-Aligned Bounding-Box
of the face of the mesh according to what is seen by users.
- uvP, uvQ, and uvR are the alignment of the texture according to the current mesh face, in texture coordinates.

- Pmesh, Qmesh, and Rmesh are the vertices of the mesh face in world coordinates

- clipping AABB to frame buffer is making sure that the pixels that are set are actually going to be on-screen. We will be using those i and j values to loop and set the pixels. Screen space has a corner (0,0).

    - We are now going to find the barycentric coordinates of the pixels inside each face (basically, a point inside the triangle).

- we are guaranteed that the barycentric coordinates add

up to 1 -- e.g., a = 0.6, b = 0.25, c = 0.15, a + b + c = 1.0. This

allows us to only try to find two barycentric coordinates

and subtract both from 1.

- Now we loop through each pixel in within the face.

- Find the barycentric coordinates of the pixel (laI, muI, and nuI)

- If any of the coordinates are negative, they are not inside the face, so we will not set the pixel.

- getColor is a function which converts the texture coordinates, the array indices that will wrap (between 0 and 1), and convert them into bitmap coordinates so that we may find the offset of the coordinates in the bitmap image and find the color coordinates from there. (R, G, B) = (0, 1, 2).

    - We create a spotlight through fspot, ftot, and frag_color. This is done by finding the fraction of light that the pixel receives.

- After we find the fraction of light, we apply it to the already existing 

color. We also make sure the opacity/alpha value is still 1 after application.

- Then we set the pixel.
